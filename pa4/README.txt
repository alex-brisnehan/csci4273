HowToMake: make
HowToRun: Two terminals. Run the correct version of each on either to not interfere with ports or input different ports. EX: ./perMessageHostOne
Bugs: Nope
Times: Both perMessage: 107 ms
       Both perProto: 128 ms
       One of each: 102 ms
The times might not be correct as I don't think I measured them in a correct way

Other: The network libraries were taken from moodle
